            <h1>Ancient lake in Mars's Gale crater may have actually been a small pond</h1>

                A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. 
                NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale crater for more than eight years, 
                and while early observations suggested the entire crater may once have been filled 
                with water, a new analysis implies that it just had a series of ponds instead.
